# 🎙️ 30 Days of Voice Agents

This repository contains my projects for the **30 Days of Voice Agents** challenge organized by Murf AI.

Every day, I'll build a new project that explores voice technologies using tools like Flask, JavaScript, and AI APIs. Each day has its own folder with clean, runnable code.

## 🧠 What’s Inside

- Daily projects in separate folders (Day01, Day02, …)
- Flask-based web apps
- JavaScript interactions
- Voice tech integrations (coming in later days)

## 🛠 Tech Used

- Python & Flask
- HTML / CSS / Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- Voice APIs (upcoming)

## ▶️ How to Run a Project

1. Open the folder for the day you want to run (e.g., `Day01`)
2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Flask app:
python app.py
4. Visit in your browser:
http://localhost:5000

<strong>Let’s build, learn, and explore — one day at a time. 🚀</strong>
