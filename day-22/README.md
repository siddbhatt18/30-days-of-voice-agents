# Day 22: Real-Time Audio Playback in the UI

Welcome to Day 22 of the 30 Days of Voice Agents Challenge\! Today, we're bringing our voice agent to life by **playing the streamed audio directly in the user interface as it arrives**.

## ðŸ§  What We Built

  * **Seamless Audio Playback**: Implemented a sophisticated audio playback system on the client-side that takes incoming base64 audio chunks, decodes them, and plays them in a continuous, uninterrupted stream.
  * **Dynamic Audio Queue**: Created a queueing mechanism in JavaScript to manage the incoming audio chunks. This ensures that as soon as one chunk finishes playing, the next one is ready to go, providing a seamless listening experience.
  * **Real-Time User Experience**: The user can now hear the agent's response as it's being generated, dramatically reducing perceived latency and creating a more natural, conversational interaction.
  * **UI Feedback**: The user interface now provides visual feedback, indicating when the agent is speaking.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

The tech stack is largely the same, with significant enhancements to the frontend JavaScript to handle real-time audio.

  * **Backend**: `FastAPI`, `uvicorn`, `requests`, `assemblyai`, `google-generativeai` (with streaming), `python-dotenv`, `websockets`
  * **Frontend**: `HTML`, `Bootstrap`, `JavaScript` (with `AudioContext` and `WebSocket API`), `MediaRecorder` API
  * **AI APIs**:
      * Murf AI (Streaming Text-to-Speech via WebSockets)
      * AssemblyAI (Real-Time Speech-to-Text with Turn Detection)
      * Google Gemini (Streaming Large Language Model)

## ðŸš€ Run the App

1.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd day-22/
    ```
2.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Create a `.env` file** and add your API keys:
    ```
    MURF_API_KEY="your_murf_api_key_here"
    ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY="your_assemblyai_api_key_here"
    GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"
    ```
4.  **Run the FastAPI server:**
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
5.  **Open your browser** and visit `http://localhost:8000`. Grant microphone permissions if prompted.
