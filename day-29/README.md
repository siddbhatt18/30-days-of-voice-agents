# Day 29: Documentation and Project Finalization

Welcome to Day 29 of the 30 Days of Voice Agents Challenge\! As we approach the end of our challenge, today was dedicated to a crucial aspect of any software project: documentation. We have reviewed, refined, and updated our `README.md` to ensure it is clear, accurate, and helpful for anyone interested in our project.

## ðŸ§  Focus for Today

  * **Comprehensive Documentation Review**: We performed a thorough review of the entire `README.md` file to ensure all sections are up-to-date with the project's current state.
  * **Improving Clarity**: The instructions, project structure, and tech stack descriptions were refined for better readability and understanding.
  * **Final Preparations**: Polishing the documentation is a key step in preparing the project for its final showcase and for future users or developers. No new features were added; the focus was purely on quality.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

The tech stack remains the same as our deployed version.

  * **Backend**: `FastAPI`, `uvicorn`, `requests`, `assemblyai`, `google-generativeai`, `python-dotenv`, `websockets`, `google-search-results`
  * **Frontend**: `HTML`, `Bootstrap`, `JavaScript` (with `AudioContext` and `WebSocket API`)
  * **Deployment**: `Render.com`
  * **AI APIs**:
      * Murf AI (Streaming Text-to-Speech)
      * AssemblyAI (Real-Time Speech-to-Text with Turn Detection)
      * Google Gemini (Streaming LLM with Function Calling)
      * SerpAPI (Real-time Google Search Results)
