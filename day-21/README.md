# Day 21: Streaming Audio to the Client

Welcome to Day 21 of the 30 Days of Voice Agents Challenge\! Today, we're completing the real-time loop by **streaming the synthesized audio from the server directly to the client** over WebSockets.

## ðŸ§  What We Built

  * **End-to-End Audio Streaming**: The base64 encoded audio chunks received from Murf AI are now streamed in real-time from our FastAPI server to the client's browser.
  * **Client-Side Audio Assembly**: The frontend JavaScript code has been updated to receive the incoming audio chunks and accumulate them into an array, preparing them for playback.
  * **Real-Time Acknowledgement**: The client now sends an acknowledgement back to the server for each audio chunk it receives, which is printed on the client's browser console for verification.
  * **Full Conversational Loop**: This step completes the entire streaming pipeline: the user speaks, the audio is transcribed in real-time, the transcription is sent to a streaming LLM, the LLM's text response is streamed to a TTS service, and the resulting audio is streamed back to the client.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

The tech stack remains consistent, with a focus on real-time communication between the client and server.

  * **Backend**: `FastAPI`, `uvicorn`, `requests`, `assemblyai`, `google-generativeai` (with streaming), `python-dotenv`, `websockets`
  * **Frontend**: `HTML`, `Bootstrap`, `JavaScript`, `MediaRecorder` API, `WebSocket API`
  * **AI APIs**:
      * Murf AI (Streaming Text-to-Speech via WebSockets)
      * AssemblyAI (Real-Time Speech-to-Text with Turn Detection)
      * Google Gemini (Streaming Large Language Model)

## ðŸš€ Run the App

1.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd day-21/
    ```
2.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Create a `.env` file** and add your API keys:
    ```
    MURF_API_KEY="your_murf_api_key_here"
    ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY="your_assemblyai_api_key_here"
    GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"
    ```
4.  **Run the FastAPI server:**
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
5.  **Open your browser** and visit `http://localhost:8000`. Grant microphone permissions if prompted.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

The main changes are in `main.py` to send audio chunks and `static/script.js` to receive them.
