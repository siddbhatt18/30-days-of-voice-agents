# Day 24: Giving the Agent a Personality

Welcome to Day 24 of the 30 Days of Voice Agents Challenge\! Today, we've given our AI agent a distinct persona to make it more engaging and memorable.

## ðŸ§  What We Built

  * **Persona Integration**: The agent now has a defined persona ("MARVIS" - Machine-based Assistant for Research, Voice, and Interactive Services), making interactions more engaging and consistent.
  * **Complete Pipeline Integration**: We've successfully connected the real-time Speech-to-Text, Large Language Model, and streaming Text-to-Speech services into a single, seamless pipeline.
  * **Stateful Conversation**: The agent now maintains a chat history, allowing for context-aware conversations that feel more natural and intelligent.
  * **End-to-End Voice Interaction**: The user can speak a query, and the agent will transcribe it, generate a thoughtful response, and stream the audio back to the user in real-time.
  * **Fully Functional Conversational Agent**: This marks the culmination of our efforts, resulting in a complete, voice-in, voice-out conversational AI that can handle dynamic interactions.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

The tech stack remains consistent, with all components now working in harmony.

  * **Backend**: `FastAPI`, `uvicorn`, `requests`, `assemblyai`, `google-generativeai`, `python-dotenv`, `websockets`
  * **Frontend**: `HTML`, `Bootstrap`, `JavaScript` (with `AudioContext` and `WebSocket API`), `MediaRecorder` API
  * **AI APIs**:
      * Murf AI (Streaming Text-to-Speech)
      * AssemblyAI (Real-Time Speech-to-Text with Turn Detection)
      * Google Gemini (Streaming Large Language Model)

## ðŸš€ Run the App

1.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd "AI Voice Agent"
    ```
2.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Create a `.env` file** and add your API keys:
    ```
    MURF_API_KEY="your_murf_api_key_here"
    ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY="your_assemblyai_api_key_here"
    GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"
    ```
4.  **Run the FastAPI server:**
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
5.  **Open your browser** and visit `http://localhost:8000`. Grant microphone permissions if prompted.
